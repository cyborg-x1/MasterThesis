The current procedure mostly doesn't find signs in every frame, the reason for that is the very high congruence and coverage
treshhold. When decreasing it, the signs are found more often, but there are also many false positives. False positives are
even worse than only finding a surface once in 100 frames. When a robot drives along a track or just 
straight forward in the direction of a sign. There are many different viewing angles and a lot of frames will pass the algorithm
till it reaches a point where it can't see the sign, so there are a lot of chances to get a positive and a true match. But if
using a lower minimum for the congruence a lot of false positives may occur, so a method has to be found to find out
which one is a true and which one a false result if gathering two, or more different matches for a surface.
